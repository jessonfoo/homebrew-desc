SYNOPSIS

    brew desc package-name1 package-name2 ...
    brew desc -s|--search string|regex
    brew desc -n|--name string|regex
    brew desc -d|--desc string|regex
    brew desc [-h|-?|--help]

USAGE

    brew desc provides brief descriptions of the software that brew installs.

    For cases where you know the items you want described, simply pass one or
    more names directly to brew desc.

    Alternatively, you can search available formulas for what you want using
    a flag. The -s|--search flag looks for matches in names and descriptions
    of brew software. The -n|--name flag limits the search to software names,
    and the -d|--desc flag restricts the search to software descriptions.

    Each of these three flags requires an argument. The argument can be
    a simple string or a regular expression. (If you use a regex, place it in
    single quotes to protect it from your shell.) All searches are treated as
    case insensitive.

FLAGS

    -s, --search WANTED         Search both names and descriptions for WANTED
    -n, --name WANTED           Search only names for WANTED
    -d, --desc WANTED           Search only descriptions for WANTED
    -h, --help, -?              Show this help message

EXAMPLES

    brew desc mutt abook        # Get descriptions for these items
    brew desc --search mail     # Search for 'mail' in names and descriptions
    brew desc -s 'ma(il|n)'     # Search for 'mail' or 'man'
    brew desc -n mail           # Search only package names for 'mail'
    brew desc -d mail           # Search only package descriptions for 'mail'
